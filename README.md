## 🌐 Overview

In many parts of East Africa, access to credit is limited due to a lack of formal banking services. This project solves that by leveraging:
- **Ethereum blockchain** for secure, transparent smart contracts
- **Firebase** for user data and authentication
- **Mobile Money APIs (e.g., M-Pesa)** for local currency integration

## 💡 Features

- Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending via smart contracts
- Collateral support using tokenized assets
- Real-time user data management with Firebase
- Integration with mobile wallets
- Frontend accessible via browser or mobile
